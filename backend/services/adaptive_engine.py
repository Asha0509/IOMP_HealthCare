Adaptive Questioning Engine
---------------------------
Implements the dynamic follow-up questioning system using:
  - Decision tree per symptom (from knowledge graph)
  - Bayesian posterior update as answers accumulate
  - Session state tracked in Redis
  - Gemini-based intelligent question filtering

This is the Adaptive Questioning Engine from the system architecture.
